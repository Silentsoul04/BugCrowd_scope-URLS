# BugCrowd_scope-URLS


Bash script to download all of your private invites URL and all of Public bug bounty URL's


You will need to install pup from https://github.com/ericchiang/pup ( great tool to grep HTML pages)
Replace <<token>> with your crowdsessionid to pull private scope URL's
If no crowdsessionid is provided then only Public list will be downloaded

  this can still be filtered to suit your needs to directly feed it to your recon like I do.
